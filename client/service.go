/*
Package client is an internal package, implementing the raw interface to the
Pact CLI tools: The Pact Mock Service and Provider Verification "binaries."

See https://github.com/pact-foundation/pact-provider-verifier and
https://github.com/bethesque/pact-mock_service for more on the Ruby "binaries".

NOTE: The ultimate goal here is to replace the Ruby dependencies with a shared
library (Pact Reference - (https://github.com/pact-foundation/pact-reference/).
